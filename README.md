# K-Means Clustering Implementation

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of the K-means clustering method using linear programming models and network flow techniques.

- **Phase 1**: Implementation of the K-means algorithm using a linear programming model in MiniZinc, optimizing for cluster assignments.
- **Phase 2**: Implementation using network design techniques and the NetworkX library, leveraging graph representations for clustering.
- **Phase 3**: Estimating the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method with the built-in K-means algorithm of the sklearn library.

## Features
- **Linear Programming Model**: Utilizes MiniZinc for optimizing cluster assignments.
- **Network Flow Implementation**: Leverages NetworkX library for graph-based clustering.
- **Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters**: Employs sklearn's K-means for determining the optimal number of clusters.

## Requirements
- `MiniZinc`
- `NetworkX library`
- `sklearn library`
